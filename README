OCaml-WLC
=========

Experimental OCaml binding for Wlc (http://github.com/Cloudef/wlc).

Implementation details
----------------------

- *_{view/space/...}_userdata functions are not bound. It could be done, but
   there is no need to bloat the binding since we can have hashtables
   {view/space/...} -> anything in OCaml.

- wl_lists are not finely bound. Functions returning a wl_list* return the whole
  contents as an OCaml list, and that's it. No handling of *_from_link,
  etc. wl_lists suck and they'll may disappear frow Wlc (the C library) at some
  point anyway.

- some NULL pointers may not be handled (i.e. OCaml functions taking or
  returning a `t` instead of a `option t`) probably causing a segfault in the
  NULL case. Report it if it happens.

- I tried to order the various functions in submodules, causing some renamings
  for module dependencies reasons. Names of functions and variants is not
  written in stone and can be discussed.
